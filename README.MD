# PyBot,

As as school project we were supposed to program a bot that will only trigger if he's called by its prefix (mine is /p03)

It was supposed to do 3 things :
- [x] Answer to /ping and say pong
- [x] Send cat pictures (with cataas)
- [x] Send meteo data on a embed message
- In extra :
	- Mine is a pokedex, you can ask data from a pokemon (name in french)
	- I've done an other bot (PyBomb) playing the bomb game, not decrementing but doing Syracuse's follow
